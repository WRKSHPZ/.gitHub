# WRKSHP #5 - Boost your Azure Functions with API Management (april 2024)

Meetup link TBD

## Wat gaan we doen?
Are you wasting precious development time adding authentication and other features to your PowerShell Azure Functions? Stop doing this and start leveraging the power of serverless Azure API Management.

In this talk you will learn how to use API Management to add authentication and you will also learn how to connect to the Azure Key Vault to secure your functions even more. To top it off you will learn how to set this up in a scalable way by utilizing the serverless platform. You will also learn how to set up reusable parts in your API management to save even more work.

So if you donâ€™t want to worry about security when writing PowerShell Azure Functions then join this talk to learn how to offload that!
